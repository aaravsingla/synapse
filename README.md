## 🎯 What Does Synapse Do?

Synapse handles challenging logistics scenarios such as:
- **Restaurant Overload**: Managing orders when restaurants have long prep times
- **Delivery Disputes**: Resolving damaged packaging conflicts between merchants and drivers
- **Recipient Unavailability**: Finding safe alternatives when recipients aren't available
- **Traffic Issues**: Rerouting rides and deliveries around obstacles
- **General Logistics**: Any custom scenario involving deliveries, rides, or customer service

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a **THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION → POLICY** loop:

1. **THOUGHT**: Agent reasons about the situation
2. **ACTION**: Agent calls appropriate tools with JSON arguments
3. **OBSERVATION**: System executes the tool and returns results
4. **POLICY**: Safety system evaluates confidence and provides guidance
5. **Repeat** until a final plan is reached

## 📋 Built-in Scenarios

### 🍕 Overloaded Restaurant
**Challenge**: Restaurant has 40-minute prep time, customer expects 20 minutes
```json
{
  "id": "overloaded_rest_1",
  "description": "Order #A123: merchant m_22 reports prep_time_min=40, driver d_9 is idle nearby, customer c_55 expects food in 20 minutes. Resolve with minimal wait and minimal driver idle time."
}
```

### 📦 Damaged Packaging Dispute  
**Challenge**: Spilled drink dispute between driver and merchant
```json
{
  "id": "damaged_packaging_1", 
  "description": "Order #B789: At doorstep, customer reports spilled drink. Driver d_21 claims proper handover; merchant m_88 claims packaged correctly. Collect evidence, mediate, and resolve with minimal customer displeasure and clear driver status."
}
```

### 🏠 Recipient Unavailable
**Challenge**: Package delivery with no one home
```json
{
  "id": "recipient_unavailable_1",
  "description": "Order #C456: Delivery partner d_14 arrived, recipient r_300 not available. Package is valuable. Try to contact recipient, ask permission to leave, suggest safe drop-off or nearby locker if recipient declines."
}
```

### 🚗 Traffic Obstruction
**Challenge**: Airport trip with major traffic delays
```json
{
  "id": "traffic_obstruction_1",
  "description": "Ride R_900: Passenger p_66 is en route to airport. check_traffic shows a major accident with large delay. Recalculate alternate route, notify passenger and driver, and check flight status to provide context."
}
```

### ✏️ Custom Scenarios
Create your own scenarios directly in the web interface! Just select "Custom" and describe any logistics challenge you can think of.

## 🛡️ Safety & Policy System

Synapse includes a sophisticated policy system that:

- **Estimates Confidence**: Each tool execution gets a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- **Escalation Logic**: Low confidence triggers conservative actions or human review
- **Suggested Actions**: Policy system can recommend next steps
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents high-risk actions when uncertain

### Policy Response Format
```json
{
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "escalate": false,
  "advice": "High confidence merchant fault. Proceed to refund customer.",
  "suggested_action": "issue_instant_refund",
  "suggested_args": {"order_id": "B789", "amount": 15.99}
}
```
